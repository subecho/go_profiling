This repo is a quick and dirty port of the Python profiling example from section 2.1.3 in the
book "Fast Python" by Tiago Rodrigues AntÃ£o. This is definitely _not_ a fair apples-to-apples
comparison between Python and Go since I'm using a lot of the unique features of Go in the port
and the original code was intended to be fairly naÃ¯ve to show off caching as a means of improving
performance. I just wanted to see if I could do it ðŸ˜„
